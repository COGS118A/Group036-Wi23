    "# Abstract \n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately classify grape varieties based on their yield as high, medium, or low. The data used in the project represents grape yield data, which is measured in boxes per acre and includes a variety of features such as climate conditions, the color of the grape, and the age of the vine. The model will be trained on a subset of this data, with the aim of learning to identify patterns in the data that are associated with different yield levels. Once the model is trained, it will predict the yield level of new, unseen data.\n",
    "Ultimately, the goal is to create a reliable and accurate classification model that can assist grape growers in making informed decisions about their vineyard management practices.\n",
    "(Feedback Response): Add which machine learning model you plan to use, the train/test split, any cross-validation, hyper-param tuning, as well as metrics you plan to use in 1-2 lines within the abstract as well. We plan to make our train/test split to be 80% training and 20% testing. We will use cross validation with a fold number between 5 and 10 and will tune other hyper-parameters including the learning rate, the number of branches in the tree, the size of specific subtrees, and plenty more. To tackle our problem, our main metric will be a confusion matrix that will ultimately compute an F1 score using accuracy, precision, and recall values. This will lead us to validate the effectiveness of our model/benchmark model.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research area revolves around the world of viticulture, particularly grape production in vineyards. With a growing demand for high-quality grapes and wineries, along with their economic importance, the efficiency of wine and vineyard operations relies heavily on the models that help predict yield production in certain regions around the world[1]. Viticulture as a whole has been a field of study tackled by machine learning on many occasions. Whether it’s detecting diseases in a grapevine’s leaves or using deep learning and neural networks to classify patterns in their early growing stages, models have been trained to make predictions and be evaluated by ML metrics such as accuracy or precision rates[2]. In turn, many of these models were created to make predictions on grape yields based on certain criteria such as weather conditions or pesticide use. However, one key problem is that these predictive models can be too complex and computationally expensive. Despite the growing demand, these models have failed to consider factors such as particular practices that can have a positive or negative impact on production rates or even grape varieties and the acres used to produce them. It’s also important to note that comparing current yield models to previous yield models can lead to several misinterpretations, meaning new ones must be trained on a daily basis. Too many confounding variables come into play such as limited varieties in a certain number of parcels at a certain time, grapevine locations, and the availability of workers[3]. For instance, climate change has a severe impact on wine production, which may lead to unpredictable and inconsistent data collection throughout the seasons. The models are prone to large errors and can lead to misinformation regarding the best course of action for workers on the field. Even with the technology available today, it’s quite difficult to gather this type of data and accurately pinpoint financial gains/losses based on more or less production yields. Thus, answering our question through a business lens is key to creating, evaluating, and drawing conclusions from our predictive yield model. The higher the yield, the better the grape quality and quantity which results in more revenue for the company/vineyard."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Grape yield is an important factor for grape growers as it directly impacts their revenue and profitability. Currently, grape growers rely on their experience and knowledge of vineyard management practices to estimate the yield level, which can be subjective and prone to errors. Therefore, an accurate yield classification model can greatly assist grape growers in making informed decisions about their vineyard management practices. To ensure the problem is quantifiable, we will define the yield levels based on a specific range of boxes per acre. We will also use a set of objective features to describe the grape varieties, such as temperature, vine age, grape color, and ranch location."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project will be sourced from a vineyard and consists of three separate datasets that must be merged in order to perform analysis. The first dataset is 4129 rows by 12 columns and contains information about the weekly collection of grapes and the number of boxes filled. The second dataset is 162 rows by 7 columns and provides information about each field (i.e. acreage, grafting). The last dataset contains information on the average weekly high and low temperatures, as well as the average weekly precipitation. The most critical variables for this project will most likely be the temperature and precipitation data but the box count and acreage observations will also be important. Other dependent variables that will be observed include the variety of grapes, the age of the plant, and the harvest date. Since a significant amount of data wrangling will be required, we will need to carefully prepare the data before performing the analysis and modeling."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential approach to building a classification model for this problem is to use a random forest algorithm. This approach has been shown to be effective in a variety of classification problems and is particularly well-suited to handling high-dimensional datasets with many features. We can use scikit-learn's random forest classifier package along with techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to build and optimize a model. Furthermore, we will also consider using a benchmark model, such as a simple decision tree or logistic regression, to compare the performance of the random forest model and validate its effectiveness."

    "To test the performance of the model, we will split the dataset into a training set and a test set. We will use the training set to train the model and the test set to evaluate its performance. We will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score after creating a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance. However, we will mainly focus on the F1 score of the model, since the cost of false positives and false negatives are approximately equal."

There could be potential privacy concerns if competitors intend to use these data for ulterior purposes. To avoid leaking any crucial information we will be changing the names of the grape varieties to keep the data of the vineyard as anonymous as possible.\n",

    "In cases where people rely on the predictions of the model to determine what grape varieties to grow. The outcome is likely to differ from the predictions considering that the model is built using a dataset from a particular vineyard, which may not have the same climate and soil characteristics as any other vineyard. Therefore, people who intend to completely rely on the model to make decisions on which grape varieties to plant in their vineyard may suffer an unwanted loss of profit.\n"
